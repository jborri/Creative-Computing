        <p><em>My Personal Corner of The Internet</em><br/><br/>
          My experience with the internet has always been painted in the light of customizing it to yourself. Whether it was like myspace, or club penguin, habbo hotel, you always had a little corner of the internet that you can call your own. I guess this is just using html and css to create my own corner of the internet just how I want to (albeit it limited by my ability to create something from code lol)<br/><br/><button onclick="play()">Play Audio</button><br/> <a href="./page2.html">Click to enter</a></p>
